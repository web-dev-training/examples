# The Goal
Simple. Have code samples/examples that are easy to understand by everyone. 

# The Rules
Make sure that the same examples exist for all languages. This will sometimes
get tricky but the whole point of this is to be able to go from one example
to another and apply what you've learned.

# Forking
Feel free to fork, and create pull requests. Remember, keep it simple. Someone
with zero programming experience should understand whats going on :)
